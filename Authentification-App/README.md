# Authentication App

Welcome to the Authentication App! This app provides a simple login interface with email and password input fields.

## Features

- User authentication with email and password.
- A user-friendly login interface.
- A logoaut button on the home page.

## Technologies Used

- React for building the user interface.
- CSS modules for styling the components.

## Learning Goals

During the development of this authentication app, I gained a deep understanding of the following React hooks and concepts:

- **useState**
- **useEffect**
- **useReducer**
- **useContext**
- **useRef**

These skills have not only enhanced my understanding of React but also equipped me with valuable tools for building more robust and dynamic web applications.
