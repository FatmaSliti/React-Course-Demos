# Toggle-List-App (Class-Based Component)

## Brief Presentation

Welcome to the Toggle-List-App! This is a simple demo application showcasing the use of class-based components and error boundaries in React. The app allows you to toggle the visibility of a list, providing a hands-on example of how to manage state and handle errors gracefully within a React application.

## Learning Goals

In this project, I aimed to achieve the following learning goals:

1. **Understanding Class-Based Components**: I practiced building components using the class-based approach, which was common in React before the introduction of functional components with hooks.

2. **State Management**: I explored how to manage the state of a component to control the visibility of the list when a user interacts with the toggle button.
