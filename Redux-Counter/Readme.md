## Description

This project served as a hands-on learning experience for mastering Redux with the help of Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit greatly simplified the setup of Redux, enabling efficient state management. I utilized `createSlice` to define reducers effortlessly, which improved code organization and maintainability.

Connecting components to the Redux store was a breeze with Redux Toolkit, thanks to its intuitive API. Redux DevTools, integrated seamlessly with Redux Toolkit, allowed for real-time state inspection and debugging, streamlining the development process.
