# Custom Hooks Demos

Welcome to the Custom Hooks Demos repository! This repository contains two simple React applications, "Counter-App" and "Add-Task-App," for building custom React hooks.

## Counter-App

**Counter-App** is a basic React application that demonstrates the use of a custom React hook to manage and display a counter.

## Custom HTTP Request Hook

In the **Add-Task-App**, we have created a custom React hook, `useHttp`, to simplify HTTP requests. This hook abstracts away the complexity of making API calls and handling loading and error states.
